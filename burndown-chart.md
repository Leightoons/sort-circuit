## Implementation Notes

1. The project follows a front-loaded approach with heavier technical implementation in the early weeks.
2. Story points follow a Fibonacci-like sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) to represent complexity and effort.
3. The core algorithm implementation and execution engine are the most complex parts of the project.
4. Later weeks focus on user experience improvements and feature refinement.
5. Testing is integrated throughout the development process, with dedicated time in the final week.
